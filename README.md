# üöë AI-Based Smart Ambulance Routing and ICU Bed Prediction

## üß† Project Overview
This project aims to optimize ambulance routing and predict ICU bed availability in nearby hospitals using artificial intelligence.  
By combining real-time traffic data, hospital capacity data, and predictive analytics, the system ensures faster emergency response and efficient patient transfer to the right healthcare facility.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- To find the **shortest and fastest route** for ambulances using AI-based algorithms.  
- To **predict ICU bed availability** in nearby hospitals.  
- To **reduce patient waiting time** and improve emergency response efficiency.  
- To provide a **visual and data-driven dashboard** for healthcare decision-making.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI)  
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express.js  
- **Machine Learning:** Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)  
- **Database:** MongoDB / Firebase (as applicable)  
- **Deployment:** Lovable / Netlify

## üó∫Ô∏è System Workflow
1. **Input:** Ambulance location and destination hospital.  
2. **Routing:** AI model calculates the shortest route using Dijkstra or A* algorithm.  
3. **Prediction:** ICU bed availability is forecasted based on historical data and real-time inputs.  
4. **Output:** Optimal hospital recommendation and route displayed on dashboard.
